Hello! I'm Artjom. I'm a software engineer with a deep interest in databases, distributed systems, and system design. I'm currently working on ocaml_db, a learning project to better understand database internals, and developing a bouldering app to combine my passion for climbing with programming (and also make something that my friends might use).
